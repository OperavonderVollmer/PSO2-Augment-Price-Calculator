Good day, I made a quick little script that helps pea-brains like myself and sharing it in case anyone else wants it

REQUIREMENTS:<br>
python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)<br>
Phantasy Star 2 Online New Genesis (https://www.pso2.com)<br>
A working internet connection (tragic)<br>
The ability to read (hard ask, I know)

How to use:<br>
Augment Price Calculator (APC) multiplies the values of the current prices of the components of the selected augment (that the user inputs) by how many it requires to create the end product. At the end, it returns the total price as well as the necessary price (with tax) one needs to sell the end product to make a profit
